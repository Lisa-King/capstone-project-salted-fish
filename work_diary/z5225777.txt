I am building the front-end part of the project with Keyu. I build some static parts include addRoleProject.js, createProject.js. 

Week 5
Build the project details with Keyu. Comments function is added into project detail page. I also build the admin's page which is for 
administractor to view, hide, and unhide projects. Start to build dashboard for collaborators.

Week 6
Continue to build collaborator's dashboard. Recommended projects can be viewed correctly, which meet the user story in sprint 2. 
However, receiving invitation function is stacked due to backend bug. Static page is created though.
